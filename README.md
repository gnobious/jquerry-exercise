# A simple landing page using Jquery

A small landing page exercises in jquery syntax.

## Experience 🎓

In this project i practiced Jquery syntax:

- Connecting Jquery lib to a project;
- Using Jquery event listeners;
- Jquery selectors;
- Jquery animations.

## Tasks 📋

1. Connect Jquery to the project.
2. Create a js file and connect it to the page.
3. Write an event handler that does not allow scripts to be executed before the page loads.
4. Write a function that, when you click on "Choose a tour”," Get advice” or "Tour Schedule" (all 3 elements), activated the slow appearance on the page (through transparency) overlay, and the modal window (modal class) smoothly moved out from above.
5. Write a function for reverse changes when clicking on the cross: overlay disappears, the modal window goes up.
6. Check that everything works and there are no errors in the console.
